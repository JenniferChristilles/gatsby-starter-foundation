Hello! Welcome to my blog! I hope to talk about some very interesting topics on here.

I'm a beginner web developer just trying to learn more and I can't wait to expand upon my research here. I currently study at Raritan Valley Community College in the idmx program. Here are some fun facts about me:

* I have an orange cat named Pumpkin.
* I love to crochet.
* I work at a pet supply store.

I hope you enjoy my posts! :)
